# Library data stortelling

Website for the data storytelling project

## Website development

This site is a copy of the Mediumish Jekyll theme, which is a Jekyll theme inspired by Mediumâ€™s design. It is a minimalistic and responsive theme that focuses on writing matters. It is a perfect starting point for a Medium-like blog.

That theme was created by Sal and you can find it [at Mediumish Jekyll theme](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll). The theme is licensed under the MIT license.
