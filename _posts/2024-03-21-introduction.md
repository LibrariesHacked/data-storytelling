About two months ago, on [the library data blog](https://blog.librarydata.uk/), I published a post with an idea for a new project. <!--more-->

> This is a invitation to public library organisations to get involved in a new project.

> The idea: a set of data stories using public library data, each with a beautiful data visualisation, and published in physical and digital form.

This was inspired by many things. The impact and beauty of projects like [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/), the power of data storytelling to inform, educate, and entertain, as well as the obvious untapped potential of public library data.

A couple of months later, and the idea is slowly starting to take shape. I've been talking with a small group of people to develop the idea, and getting ready to start the project in earnest.

Interested individuals can mainly be split into two groups (sometimes overlapping):

1. **The community group** - people who are interested in the project, and want to see how it could help them. They would be helped by a community of practice for library data, mainly online, sometimes in person. Not necessarily ready to commit immediately to a specific project, but who want to be involved.
2. **The first storytellers** - people who have been waiting for an opportunity to tell a story with data. They want to get started and create something specific.

Both of these are important. The community group will help to shape the project, and make sure it is relevant and useful. The first storytellers will help to create some of the first content pieces, and make sure it is engaging and informative.

See the [about page](/about) for more detailed information on the project. Get in touch if you have any thoughts or ideas. I'm looking forward to getting started!
