# Introduction

About two months ago, on [the library data blog](https://blog.librarydata.uk/), I published a post with an idea for a new project.

> This is a invitation to public library organisations to get involved in a new project.
>
> The idea: **create a set of data stories using public library data, add a beautiful data visualisation for each one, and publish in physical and digital form.**

I was inspired by many things. The success and beauty of projects like [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/), the power of data storytelling to inform, educate, and entertain, and the obvious untapped potential of public library data.

A couple of months later, and the idea is slowly starting to take shape. I've been working with a small group of people to develop the idea, and getting ready to start the project in earnest.

There have been two 'groups' of contributors so far (sometimes overlapping):

1. **The community group** - people who are interested in the project, and want to help shape it. They would be helped by a community of practice for library data, mainly online, sometimes in person. Not necessarily ready to commit to a detailed project, but want to be involved and learn.
2. **The first storytellers** - people who have been waiting for an opportunity to tell a story with data. They are ready to commit to a project, and want to get started.

Both of these groups are important. The community group will help to shape the project, and make sure it is relevant and useful. The first storytellers will help to create some of the first content pieces, and make sure it is engaging and informative.

See the [information page](/about.html) for more detailed information on the project. Get in touch if you have any thoughts or ideas. I'm looking forward to getting started!
